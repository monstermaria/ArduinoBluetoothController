# ArduinoBluetoothController

This is a school project in an android course. It enables an android device to communicate with an arduino via serial communication over bluetooth.

It should not be seen as a finished program, but as a proof of concept. I got the idea for the project from a company that manufactures frequency converters, and wanted a way to interact with their hardware from an android app.
